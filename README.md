# Raconteur

> Raconteur: "a person who is skilled in relating stories and anecdotes interestingly."

Build your own website, community, and audience without giving up control. An open source fediverse server designed for content and community websites.

## Content & Community Fediverse Server

Raconteur, also known as WisTex Raconteur, is a soft fork of Streams, an open source fediverse server with a long history of innovation. The core fediverse functionality of Raconteur comes from Streams, and this project is kept in sync with the Streams Repository (one way only).

This fork is specifically modified to cater to content creators and those that want to create a community around content.

Compatible with ActivityPub, Zot, Nomad, and OpenWebAuth (Magic Sign-On).

## Current Status

We just created this repository, and at this point, it is mostly just Streams. We will be adding new themes, addons, and widgets to it soon.

## Project

We are still setting everything up, but for the time being, here is the relevant information:

* Website: `coming soon`
* Repository: https://github.com/WisTex/Raconteur
* Documentation: `coming soon`
* Support Forum: `coming soon`
